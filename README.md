# github-star-counter
User script that requests github API to get star counts of Github Repos.
Stars are shown after repos' links. 
Useful when inspecting awesome pages.


1. github token can be set to increase limit of API.
2. cache can be enabled to reduce API calling.
3. both can be set under extension menu by using `GM_registerMenuCommand`.
